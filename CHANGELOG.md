# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented here.

## Unreleased

- Make enrichment caches Promise-capable and schema/source-namespaced, store and
  revalidate only normalized structured reports, add response-driven
  `cacheTtlMsFor` lifetimes (including explicit no-hit negative caching), and map
  asynchronous store/TTL failures to bounded machine-readable degradation.
- Bound every configured enricher by default and isolate provider, cache,
  cache-key, governor admission, and governor lifecycle failures as structured
  per-source outcomes without discarding valid sibling/provider evidence.
- Add deterministic staged enrichment orchestration with per-enricher dependency
  tokens, accumulated prior outcomes, explicit prerequisite/plan/cycle skips,
  stable fan-out/fan-in serialization, and subject-aware finding suppression.
- Bump the result schema to 1.3 and add optional, versioned structured enrichment
  outcomes/evidence for `inspectAsync()`, including source identity validation,
  explicit success/no-hit/skipped/failure states, JSON-safe payloads, preserved
  provenance/freshness, and a compatibility adapter for legacy finding arrays.
