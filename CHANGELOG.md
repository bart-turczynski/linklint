# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented here.

## Unreleased

- Add deterministic staged enrichment orchestration with per-enricher dependency
  tokens, accumulated prior outcomes, explicit prerequisite/plan/cycle skips,
  stable fan-out/fan-in serialization, and subject-aware finding suppression.
- Bump the result schema to 1.3 and add optional, versioned structured enrichment
  outcomes/evidence for `inspectAsync()`, including source identity validation,
  explicit success/no-hit/skipped/failure states, JSON-safe payloads, preserved
  provenance/freshness, and a compatibility adapter for legacy finding arrays.
