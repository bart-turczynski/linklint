## Bumping the `tldts` or `tr46` pin

These two dependencies are **not ordinary dependencies** — they carry the Public
Suffix List and the UTS-46/Unicode tables that linklint's verdicts are computed
from. A patch-level bump can silently redraw a registrable-domain boundary or
move a normalization result. Treat it as a data change, not a version bump.

`pnpm check` already runs all three gates below; this is the order to work in.

1. **Bump the pin and its stamps together.** Update `DATA_VERSIONS`
   (`src/data/versions.ts`) and, for `tldts`, all three fields of
   `PSL_PROVENANCE` (`src/data/psl-provenance.ts`). `data-versions.test.ts`
   asserts the stamps match the installed versions, and `psl-provenance.test.ts`
   pins the two `tldts` records to each other.

2. **Check the blast radius on linklint's own answers.**

   ```sh
   pnpm data:boundary --check
   ```

   This diffs the committed baseline (255 hosts: the brand watchlist, every
   corpus vector, the upstream PSL corpus, and the IMC '23 multi-tenant eTLDs)
   against what the new pin produces, and reports every host whose registrable
   domain, PSL section, or normalization result moved. **Read the diff.** A
   `SECTION MOVES` entry — a rule crossing the ICANN/PRIVATE boundary — deserves
   particular attention: it changes one boundary view while leaving the other
   intact, so it can shift detector behaviour without any conformance test
   noticing.

   If the change is intended, regenerate and commit the baseline **in the same
   commit as the bump**, so review sees the pin and its consequences together:

   ```sh
   pnpm data:boundary
   ```

3. **Confirm upstream conformance still holds.** `psl-conformance.test.ts` and
   `idna-conformance.test.ts` run the full upstream corpora. A new divergence
   must be triaged as a linklint bug or a documented, justified profile
   difference — recorded in `docs/architecture.md` §6.1/§6.2 and in the test's
   ledger. **Never silently allowlist one.**

   If a bump moves the *Unicode* version behind `tr46` (not just its own
   version), refresh the vendored `IdnaTestV2.txt` to match — see
   `packages/core/test/data/README.md`.
