Each reason is `{ code, layer, detail, weight }`. The `weight` is attached by the
core from the version-pinned table; detectors never supply their own weight.

## Informational codes (weight 0)

These **annotate** but never raise severity. They exist so legitimate IDNs are
explained, not flagged (PRD Principle 5, FR-D-15/16, SC-1a/SC-2). A result whose
only reasons are informational is **benign** (`score: 0`, `severity: "info"`).

### `normalization_delta` — FR-D-1

- **Meaning:** the host differs from its normalized / ACE (punycode) form.
- **Why it's a signal:** any internationalized domain triggers it by definition,
  so on its own it means only "this host uses non-ASCII." It becomes meaningful
  **in combination** with a scoring detector (e.g. `mixed_script`).
- **Example:** `bücher.de` is an IDN; its ASCII/punycode form is `xn--bcher-kva.de`.
  Benign alone — every IDN trips this, so it carries no suspicion by itself.
- **Scoring:** informational, weight 0.

### `confusable_char` — FR-D-2

- **Meaning:** one or more characters in the **host** are confusable with
  characters from another script (per the curated confusables set).
- **Why it's a signal:** annotation only. Scoring a single-script whole-label
  homograph needs a brand/skeleton index (roadmap), so raw confusable annotation
  must not score or legitimate IDNs would be penalized.
- **Example:** Cyrillic `а` (U+0430) where Latin `a` (U+0061) is expected.
- **Scoring:** informational, weight 0. Expanded per-character in `confusables[]`.

### `confusable_in_path` — FR-D-12

- **Meaning:** as `confusable_char`, but for the **path / query** components.
- **Why it's a signal:** annotation only, same reasoning as `confusable_char`.
- **Example:** a Cyrillic letter inside `/раy/`.
- **Scoring:** informational, weight 0. Expanded per-character in `confusables[]`.
- **See also:** `brand_in_path` (J7) — the scoring counterpart for a brand
  *keyword* in the path (vs. confusable *characters* here).

### `idna_mapping_ambiguity` — Epic J (J9)

- **Meaning:** the host maps to a **different ASCII domain depending on the IDNA
  standard** applied — so the component that validates the URL and the one that
  resolves it can reach different sites (Tsai, _Abusing IDNA Standard_). Distinct
  from `confusable_char` (visual similarity): this is **resolver disagreement**.
- **Detection:** the host is run through `tr46` in both modes — transitional
  (≈ IDNA2003) and non-transitional (UTS-46/IDNA2008). Two groups fire:
  - **Group A — deviation chars** (ß, ς, ZWJ, ZWNJ): the two ASCII forms differ.
    `wordpreß.com` → `wordpress.com` (IDNA2003) vs `xn--wordpre-6va.com` (UTS-46).
  - **Group B — compatibility folds** (fullwidth / circled Latin): the host folds
    entirely to ASCII with no punycode. `ｇｏｏｇｌｅ.com` → `google.com`.
- **Why informational (weight 0):** a lone ß is a legitimate German IDN (`baß.de`
  is registrable), so the base signal must not raise severity (SC-2). **Epic G**
  adds the scoring escalation: when the alternate IDNA2003 mapping equals a known
  brand (`wordpreß` → `wordpress`), it becomes an impersonation signal. (Decision
  on the brainstorm's OQ-J9b: informational until the brand list lands.)
- **Scoring:** informational, weight 0.

## Scoring codes

These contribute to the risk score via probabilistic OR (`docs/scoring.md`).

### `mixed_script` — FR-D-3 · weight 0.4

- **Meaning:** a single host label mixes characters from more than one script
  (e.g. Latin + Cyrillic in one label).
- **Why it's a signal:** the cross-script de-noiser. Legitimate IDNs are
  single-script; mixing scripts within a label is the hallmark of a homograph
  attack. This is the code that actually scores confusable-based deception.
- **Example:** `pаypal.com` where `а` is Cyrillic (label mixes Latin + Cyrillic).

### `ascii_homoglyph` — Epic J (J4) · weight 0.2

- **Meaning:** a host label uses **same-script (ASCII) digit look-alikes for
  letters** — `g00gle`, `paypa1`, `micr0soft`. The general, brand-free counterpart
  to `mixed_script` / `confusable_char`, which only fire when two *different*
  scripts mix and so never see an all-ASCII disguise.
- **Why it's a signal:** a low-weight structural anomaly. A digit standing in for
  the letter it resembles, inside an otherwise alphabetic word, is rare in
  legitimate hosts.
- **Detection & precision (SC-2):** a label flags only when it is pure ASCII
  alphanumeric (length ≥ 5), its first character is a letter (a leading digit
  reads as an obvious number — `1password`, `0day`), every digit is one of the
  unambiguous letter-shaped digits `0`→o / `1`→l / `5`→s (any other digit
  disqualifies the whole label, so `s3`, `web3`, `route53`, `i18n`, `bet365`,
  `blink182` never flag), and letters outnumber those digits. The detail surfaces
  the readable skeleton (`g00gle` → `google`).
- **Out of scope:** letter-multigraph confusions (`rn`→m, `vv`→w) are **not**
  handled here — generically they fire on ordinary words (`modern`, `return`,
  `savvy`) and can only be told apart from an attack by distance to a known brand.
  That, and the scoring escalation when a skeleton equals a real brand, belong to
  the brand-aware layer (Epic G). This base signal stays `low` so a lone
  digit-in-word matters only in combination.
- **Example:** `https://g00gle.com` (reads as `google`); `https://paypa1.com`.

### `brand_in_path` — Epic J (J7) · weight 0.2

- **Meaning:** a **brand reference is planted in the path/query** of an unrelated
  host. The scoring counterpart to the info-only `confusable_in_path`: that flags
  confusable *characters* in the path, this flags a brand *keyword*.
- **Why it's a signal:** `https://evil.com/paypal.com/login` resolves to
  `evil.com`, but a skimming user sees `paypal.com` in the URL and trusts it.
- **Detection & precision (SC-2):** fires only on two phishing-shaped patterns,
  and only when the brand does **not** appear in the host:
  - **domain-shaped** — a path/query token `<brand>.<tld>` (`/paypal.com/`,
    `?next=paypal.com`);
  - **credential flow** — a bare `<brand>` path segment together with a
    credential-flow word (`login`, `signin`, `verify`, …): `/paypal/login`.
  So a brand's own site (`paypal.com/login`), a brand word in prose
  (`/blog/netflix-review`), and a bare brand path without credential context
  (`github.com/paypal/repo`) all stay clean.
- **Brand list:** a small **seed** set (`data/brands.ts`, version-pinned via
  `dataVersions.brands`). Epic G replaces it with the authoritative, expandable
  list and adds the host-side brand escalations.
- **Example:** `https://evil.com/paypal.com/login`; `https://phish.io/google/signin`.
- **Scoring:** scoring, weight 0.2.

### `suspicious_extension` — Epic I (I1) · weight 0.5

- **Meaning:** the URL **path** ends in a **dangerous executable file extension**,
  or in a **deceptive double-extension** — the high-signal shape of a
  direct-download malware link.
- **Why it's a signal:** a link that ends in `setup.exe` or `update.apk` is a
  direct request to download and run an executable; a double-extension like
  `invoice.pdf.exe` shows a safe-looking `.pdf` to a skimming user while the real,
  trailing extension is the executable.
- **Detection & precision (SC-2):** only the **last path segment** (the filename
  after the final `/`) is inspected, and query/fragment are ignored. Two shapes
  fire:
  - **double extension** — ≥2 dot-separated extension parts after a non-empty
    stem and the LAST part is dangerous (`invoice.pdf.exe`, `report.doc.scr`);
  - **single dangerous extension** — the filename ends in one dangerous extension
    (`setup.exe`, `screensaver.scr`).
  A trailing-dot or extensionless segment, an empty path, or a bare `/` never
  fire, and an extension mid-path is ignored.
- **Dangerous set (case-insensitive):** the named class
  `.exe/.scr/.apk/.iso/.bat/.msi` plus conservative same-class additions
  (`cmd`, `com`, `vbs`, `jar`, `dmg`, `pkg`, `dll`, `msix`, `ps1`, `deb`). A
  `.zip` archive is **not** in the set — an archive download is ordinary and would
  over-flag.
- **Example:** `https://files.example.com/setup.exe`;
  `https://cdn.evil.io/invoice.pdf.exe`.
- **Scoring:** scoring, weight 0.5.

### `open_redirect_param` — Epic I (I2) · weight 0.4

- **Meaning:** a query parameter whose **name** is a known redirect parameter
  (`next`, `url`, `redirect`, `redirect_uri`, `redirect_url`, `dest`,
  `destination`, `return`, `returnUrl`, `continue`, `u`, `goto`, `target`) carries
  a **value that is itself a URL pointing to a different registrable domain** than
  the link host.
- **Why it's a signal:** `https://example.com/login?next=https://evil.com/phish`
  reads as `example.com`, but when the redirect fires the user lands on
  `evil.com`. The cross-host payload is the lexical fingerprint of an
  open-redirect lure.
- **Roadmap relocation (Phase 2 → Layer 1):** the PRD parks open-redirect under
  **Phase 2 (resolution)** because *confirming* an open redirect requires
  following it over the network. But the cross-host PAYLOAD inside the parameter
  is visible **without any network access** — a purely lexical signal — so the
  *detection* belongs in **Layer 1 (lexical)**. Phase 2 still owns the
  resolution-time confirmation of whether the redirect actually fires; this
  detector owns the offline payload detection.
- **Detection & precision (SC-2):** the value is bounded-decoded (seeing through
  single/double percent-encoding) and interpreted as a URL in two shapes:
  - **absolute URL** — scheme + host (`https://evil.com/...`);
  - **protocol-relative** — `//evil.com/...`, a classic payload that omits the
    scheme.

  Fires **only** when the decoded value resolves to a host whose registrable
  domain is non-null and **differs** (case-insensitively) from the link host's.
  A relative/same-host path (`?next=/dashboard`), a same-registrable-domain target
  (`?next=https://app.example.com/home`), a non-redirect param carrying a URL
  (`?ref=https://evil.com`), and a non-URL value (`?url=2`) all stay clean.
  Parsing is fully defensive — a junk value yields no finding and the detector
  never throws.
- **Example:** `https://example.com/login?next=https://evil.com/phish`;
  `https://example.com/?redirect=//evil.com`.
- **Scoring:** scoring, weight 0.4.

### `invisible_char` — FR-D-4 · weight 0.5

- **Meaning:** invisible, zero-width, or control characters appear anywhere in
  the URL (excluding bidi controls, which are reported as `bidi_override`).
- **Why it's a signal:** invisible characters hide differences between a
  deceptive host and a legitimate one.
- **Example:** `exa​mple.com` (zero-width space inside the host).

### `bidi_override` — FR-D-5 · weight 0.6

- **Meaning:** bidirectional / RTL override characters (U+202A–U+202E,
  U+2066–U+2069, U+061C, U+200E/U+200F) appear in the URL.
- **Why it's a signal:** bidi overrides visually reorder text — e.g. making a
  path appear to end in a safe extension.
- **Example:** a filename containing U+202E to flip `gpj.exe` to `exe.jpg`.

### `userinfo_present` — FR-D-6 · weight 0.5

- **Meaning:** the authority is hidden behind a userinfo segment (`user@host`).
- **Why it's a signal:** `https://paypal.com@evil.com` reads as PayPal but
  resolves to `evil.com`. The real host is surfaced in `parsed.effectiveHost`.
- **Example:** `https://paypal.com@evil.com/login` → real host `evil.com`.

### `ip_obfuscation` — FR-D-7 (+ J5) · weight 0.4

- **Meaning:** the host is an obfuscated IP address.
  - **IPv4** — decimal, octal, hex, or dotless form.
  - **IPv6 (J5)** — a non-canonical literal (leading zeros, uncompressed zero
    runs like `0::1` / `2001:db8:0:0:0:0:0:1`) or an **IPv4-embedding** form
    (`[::ffff:127.0.0.1]`): the validator sees an IPv6 address while the resolver
    reaches the embedded IPv4 — an SSRF masquerade. Pure case differences
    (`2001:DB8::1`) are tolerated (not a deception vector).
- **Why it's a signal:** obfuscated IPs evade human and naive string checks.
- **Detail:** renders the canonical form so the real destination is explained;
  for an IPv4-embedding IPv6 literal it also names the embedded IPv4. Canonical
  dotted-decimal IPv4 and canonical IPv6 literals (`[::1]`) are **not** flagged.
- **Example:** `http://2130706433/` (decimal for `127.0.0.1`);
  `https://[::ffff:127.0.0.1]/` (IPv6 literal embedding `127.0.0.1`).

### `embedded_domain_in_subdomain` — FR-D-8 · weight 0.5

- **Meaning:** a domain-looking label sequence appears left of the real
  registrable domain.
- **Why it's a signal:** `paypal.com.spoof.info` puts `paypal.com` in the
  subdomain; the real registrable domain is `spoof.info`. Purely lexical in v1
  (no DNS resolution of the embedded domain — FR-D-14). All contiguous windows
  of the subdomain labels are scanned (not just suffixes), so a brand domain with
  filler labels after it — `paypal.com.login.evil.com` — is still caught.
- **Example:** `https://paypal.com.spoof.info/` → real domain `spoof.info`;
  `https://paypal.com.login.evil.com/` → real domain `evil.com`.

### `excessive_subdomain_depth` — Epic I (I3) · weight 0.15

- **Meaning:** the host has an abnormally large number of **subdomain labels**
  (≥ 5 labels left of the registrable domain), e.g.
  `a.b.c.d.paypal.com.evil.tk`.
- **Why it's a signal:** stacking many subdomain labels buries the real
  registrable domain far to the right of the visible host, a known phishing
  structure. A low-weight contextual signal — it never flags on its own and only
  matters in combination with other signals.
- **Relationship to `embedded_domain_in_subdomain`:** that detector (FR-D-8)
  fires only when a window of the subdomain is itself a registrable domain;
  I3 fires on raw subdomain **depth** regardless of whether any window looks like
  a registrable domain, catching deep-burial hosts the embedded check misses.
- **Detection & precision (SC-2):** counts only the subdomain labels (everything
  left of the registrable domain) — the registrable-domain and public-suffix
  labels are excluded — and fires at the threshold of **5**. IP hosts and hosts
  with no subdomain never fire. Legitimate deep-subdomain hosts
  (`cdn.assets.eu-west-1.example.com`, 3 labels) stay clean.
- **Example:** `https://a.b.c.d.paypal.com.evil.tk/` (5 subdomain labels).
- **Scoring:** scoring, weight 0.15 (low-weight combination signal).

### `risky_tld` — FR-D-9 · weight 0.15

- **Meaning:** the registrable domain uses a high-abuse / free-registration TLD
  (e.g. `.tk`, `.ml`, `.xyz`).
- **Why it's a signal:** a low-weight contextual signal — these registries
  correlate with abuse. Low weight so it never flags on its own.
- **Relationship to `file_extension_tld`:** the extension-confusable TLDs
  `.zip` / `.mov` are **owned by `file_extension_tld`** (J6) and were removed from
  the `risky_tld` set, so the two never double-count.
- **Example:** `https://promo.tk/` (free-registration abuse TLD).

### `file_extension_tld` — Epic J (J6) · weight 0.4

- **Meaning:** the registrable domain uses a **file-extension TLD** (`.zip`,
  `.mov`) and is structured to masquerade as a downloadable file rather than a
  website. A sharper, higher-weight successor to `risky_tld` for these TLDs.
- **Why it's a signal:** `invoice.zip` reads as an archive and `setup.mov` as a
  video, yet both are live domains — a lure that pairs naturally with the J1/J2
  authority tricks and `userinfo_present`.
- **Masquerade structure** (fires only on one of these, so a real site does not
  flag — SC-2):
  - **bare filename** — the host is exactly `stem.<ext>` with no subdomain
    (`https://invoice.zip/`);
  - **hidden behind userinfo** — a `…@stem.<ext>` authority (`github.com∕x@update.zip`,
    where a J2 slash-look-alike pushes the brand into userinfo and the real host
    is the file-looking `.zip`).
- **Not flagged:** a `.zip` in the **path** (`/archive.zip` — a real file), or a
  deep-subdomain `.zip` host with no userinfo (`cdn.assets.acme.zip`).
- **Example:** `https://invoice.zip/`; `https://github.com∕x@evil.zip`.
- **Scoring:** scoring, weight 0.4.

### `encoding_obfuscation` — FR-D-10 · weight 0.35

- **Meaning:** percent-encoding hides structural characters or is multiply
  nested (double-encoding).
- **Why it's a signal:** encoded `/`, `@`, `:` or repeated `%25` chains hide the
  true structure of a URL. Recursive decoding is bounded (no decode-bomb).
- **Example:** `https://example.com%2F@evil.com` or `%252e%252e`.

### `dangerous_scheme` — FR-D-11 · weight 0.9

- **Meaning:** the scheme can execute or embed content: `javascript:`, `data:`,
  `blob:`, `file:`, `vbscript:`.
- **Why it's a signal:** these schemes are almost never legitimate in a link an
  agent or user is about to follow; highest single weight.
- **Example:** `javascript:fetch('//evil')`.

### `punycode_malformed` — E5 · weight 0.2

- **Meaning:** the host has an `xn--` (ACE) label that does not decode to a valid
  U-label under UTS-46 / Punycode.
- **Why it's a signal:** a low-weight lexical anomaly — such a host is not a
  registrable IDN and never appears in legitimate links, but it is not inherently
  an attack on its own, so it flags only at `low`. Valid IDNs are unaffected,
  including uppercase ACE (`XN--CAF-DMA` → `café`), which round-trips after
  UTS-46 case-folding.
- **Example:** `https://xn--abc.com/` or `https://xn--.com/` (undecodable ACE).

### `ambiguous_authority` — Epic J (J1) · weight 0.65

- **Meaning:** the authority is structurally ambiguous enough that two URL
  parsers would resolve it to a **different host or port** — the parser-vs-
  requester disagreement class (Orange Tsai, _A New Era of SSRF_; Snyk/Claroty,
  _Exploiting URL Parsing Confusion_).
- **Why it's a signal:** deception by construction, not a soft heuristic — a high
  weight. A flagship fit for the MCP "check before you fetch" surface: an agent
  is warned the string is ambiguous _before_ the request fires.
- **Sub-signals** (named in `detail`; one reason code regardless of how many fire):
  - `multiple_userinfo` — more than one `@` (`foo@evil.com:80@google.com`).
  - `fragment_in_authority` — a `#@…` tail (`google.com#@evil.com`).
  - `whitespace_in_authority` — whitespace inside the authority
    (`foo@127.0.0.1 @google.com` — the "curl won't fix it" bypass).
  - `multiple_port` — more than one `:` port separator (`127.0.0.1:11211:80`);
    IPv6 `[::1]:8080` is unaffected.
  - `backslash` — a `\` browsers fold to `/` (`http:\\google.com`, `https:/\…`).
  - `slash_confusion` — empty authority / 3+ slashes after the scheme
    (`http:///`, `http://///`) or a network-path reference in the path
    (`http://target.com/////evil.com`, CVE-2021-23435).
  - `protocol_relative` — a scheme-relative `//` authority (`//evil.com`).
- **Scope:** fires only when the input declares itself a URL (explicit scheme or
  `//` form). Bare scheme-less input (`google.com/abc`) is out of scope — it
  would over-trigger on benign typos (SC-2).
- **Result shape:** a parseable-but-ambiguous URL stays `status: "ok"` and adds
  this scoring reason; an unresolvable-but-ambiguous one is `status: "invalid"`
  yet now carries this reason instead of a bare `parse_error`.
- **Scoring:** scoring, weight 0.65.

### `separator_lookalike` — Epic J (J2) · weight 0.5

- **Meaning:** the authority contains a character that a downstream layer
  (browser, IDNA/NFKC normalization) maps to a **structural ASCII delimiter** — a
  dot or a slash — so the real host hides from a parser that does not normalize.
- **Why it's a signal:** `evil。com` (ideographic full stop, U+3002) resolves to
  `evil.com` in a browser but reads as one opaque label to a naive validator;
  `github.com／x@evil.zip` (fullwidth solidus) fakes a path boundary while the
  real host is `evil.zip`. Distinct from `confusable_char` (visual similarity) —
  this is about a character that becomes a *delimiter*.
- **Detected look-alikes:** dot → `.` (U+3002, U+FF0E, U+FF61, U+2024);
  slash → `/` (U+FF0F, U+2215).
- **Scope & precision (SC-2):** scanned in the **authority only** — an ideographic
  full stop is ordinary CJK punctuation inside a path (`/記事。html`) and is not
  flagged. The authority must also contain an ASCII alphanumeric, so a Latin brand
  glued by a look-alike dot fires while a pure-CJK host typed with an ideographic
  dot (normal domain entry) does not.
- **Scoring:** scoring, weight 0.5.

### `control_char` — Epic J (J3) · weight 0.6

- **Meaning:** the URL carries ASCII control or whitespace characters — **raw or
  percent-encoded** — positioned to **smuggle a protocol** or **terminate the
  host** (Orange Tsai, _A New Era of SSRF_, protocol-smuggling + glibc-NSS).
- **Why it's a signal:** a CR/LF lets the component that fires the request speak a
  second protocol on the wire (Redis `SLAVEOF`, SMTP `HELO`, Memcached `set`); a
  TAB or whitespace truncates the host so the validator and `getaddrinfo()` reach
  different destinations. A flagship MCP pre-fetch signal — the payload attacks a
  service sitting behind the server that fires the request.
- **Sub-signals** (named in `detail`; one reason code regardless of how many fire):
  `crlf` (CR/LF), `tab` (TAB), `null` (NUL), `control` (other C0/DEL), and
  `whitespace_in_host` (bare space inside a host-shaped authority). The `detail`
  also tags the encoding form: `[raw]`, `[percent-encoded]`, `[double-encoded]`.
- **Relationship to `invisible_char` (FR-D-4):** `invisible_char` already catches
  **raw** control characters (they are Unicode `Cc`) — the two co-fire there. The
  non-overlapping value of `control_char` is the **percent-encoded** (`%0D%0A`,
  `%09`) and **double-encoded** (`%250D%250A`, `%2509`) forms, which are plain
  ASCII text that `invisible_char` never sees, plus bare whitespace inside the
  authority (`Zs`, not `Cc`). Double-decoding reuses the bounded recursive decoder
  (no decode-bomb).
- **Scope & precision (SC-2):** an encoded **space** (`%20`) is not a control
  character and never flags; `whitespace_in_host` is scoped to host-shaped
  authorities (a dot plus an alphanumeric) so a space in a path or in non-URL
  prose does not flag.
- **Example:** `http://127.0.0.1:6379/%0D%0ASLAVEOF` (Redis smuggling),
  `http://127.0.0.1%09foo.google.com` (TAB host terminator).
- **Scoring:** scoring, weight 0.6.

## Meta

### `parse_error`

- **Meaning:** the input is not a parseable URL or hostname.
- **Result shape:** `status: "invalid"`, `parsed/score/severity: null`. An
  invalid result is **not benign** — a fail-closed consumer must reject it
  (FR-IN-4, SC-2a). An invalid result may instead carry an `ambiguous_authority`
  reason when the input is structurally ambiguous (see above); `parse_error` is
  the fallback when no detector explains the failure.
- **Scoring:** weight 0.
